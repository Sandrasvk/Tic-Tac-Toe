  This project was inspired by a Youtube tutorial. I understand the logic from the tutortial. I understood the logic from the tutorial and then recreated the project with my own improvements like:
  *Using a single board list multiplied by 9 instead of writing 9 buttons manually
  *Renaming variables for a better readability.

  The tutorial help me to understand the fundamental game logic and adapted the code for my own environment (Jupyter Notebook) and to practice Python variable handling.
